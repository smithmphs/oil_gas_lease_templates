    Before signing, the lessee shall provide to the lessor via its insurance company proof of the following: 1) worker's compensation and employer's liability insurance; 2) commercial general liability and umbrella liability insurance; and 3) business auto and umbrella liability insurance.  Thereafter, yearly updates of proof of the same directly from the lessee's insurance company to the lessor must be provided by the anniversary date of the signing.

8. NON-PAYMENTS AND OTHER LEASE VIOLATIONS

    If the lessee fails or refuses to make the payment of any sum due under this lease or if any of the terms of this lease are violated by the lessee, this lease may be canceled by the lessor with notification by registered letter.

9.  LEASE COMMENCEMENT AND THE PRIMARY TERM

    Lessor, in consideration of two years of delay rental at a rate of $ *______* ($ *______* per acre x *_____* acres) per year for a total lump sum payment of $ *_____* and of the royalties, covenants, and conditions contained herein to be kept and performed by the lessee, does lease exclusively to lessee the premises described above, for the purpose of exploring, drilling, and producing oil and/or gas from the leased premises for a primary term of two years and as long thereafter as oil and/or gas may be produced in commercial quantities and subject to other provisions as provided herein.  According to trade terminology, this lease shall be considered a ’paid-up’ lease and as such does not obligate the lessee to commence any operations during the primary term.  No part of this lump sum payment shall be refundable under any circumstances.  If after two years, drilling has not started, the lease shall summarily end without notice.  For the purposes of this lease, 'drilling' means that a bore hole of at least one hundred vertical feet has been drilled on the leased premises or in a pooling unit thereof and that a drilling rig is on site.

10.  DRILLING

     If the primary term expires while drilling is still being undertaken, then the lease shall remain in effect for one year as long as good faith efforts at drilling continue.  For this consideration and while these conditions remain in effect, the lessor will be due a monthly delay rental as specified in section 19 below.  If after a year production still has not commenced, this lease will summarily end without notice.

11.  PRODUCTION

    In this lease, 'production' means a state-of-affairs in which the lessor is receiving royalties on oil and/or gas being extracted from the premises. Commencement of production at one well may automatically spawn another drilling obligation as described below in section 13.

12. PRODUCTION ROYALTIES

    a. OIL ROYALTIES:  As used herein, the term ‘oil’ shall mean and refer to any hydrocarbons produced in liquid form at the well.  This includes any liquid material recovered from oil or gas run through a separator or other equipment on the premises. As royalty, lessee shall pay to the lessor 25% of the value of the gross. The gross shall be based on either (1) the market value of oil in the general vicinity; or (2) the actual proceeds of the sale of oil from the premises, whichever is greater. If the gas produced proves to have liquid hydrocarbons recoverable on the premises in commercial quantities, it is incumbent on the lessee to ensure that such recovery is done and that adequate care is taken such that the extraction is as complete as achievable using current state of the art technology.  Oil royalties shall be based on the grade, gravity and type of oil as extracted at the drilling site.

    b. GAS ROYALTIES:  As used herein, the term 'gas' shall mean and refer to any hydrocarbons produced from the premises after all liquid forms extractable on the premises have been recovered.  This includes gas with no recoverables (hereafter referred to as 'dry' gas) and gas still bearing liquid hydrocarbons which are only extractable in off-site plants (hereafter referred to as 'wet' gas).  In the case of the former, the lessee shall pay to the lessor 25% of the value of the gross. This value shall be based on either (1) the market value for dry gas in the general vicinity; or (2) the actual proceeds of the sale of dry gas from the premises, whichever is greater. The volume of gas shall be measured in accordance with current accepted technology. In the case of wet gas further processed on off-site plants, the lessee shall pay to the lessor 25% of the gross.  This value shall be calculated based on both the liquid and non-liquid content of the gas and upon prices paid by processing plants unaffiliated (either directly or indirectly) with the lessee.

    c. KEEP WHOLE PROVISION: If gas from the premises is further processed in an off-site plant, the value of the gross production shall for purposes of determining royalties will never be less than if such gas had not been processed.

    d. RECYCLED GAS: Subject to the consent in writing of the lessor, the lessee may inject gas into any oil- or gas-producing formation in the premises after the liquid hydrocarbons contained in the gas have been removed, and no royalties shall be payable on the gas so injected until such time as the same may thereafter be produced and sold or used. 

    e.  CONSERVATION: The lessee shall use all reasonable means to prevent the underground or above ground waste of oil or gas and to avoid the physical waste, flaring, or venting of gas produced from the premises.

    f. NO COST DEDUCTIONS: The lessee shall pay royalties due under this lease without deduction for the cost of producing, gathering, storing, separating, treating, dehydrating, compressing, transporting, and otherwise making the oil, gas and other products hereunder ready for sale or use.  No field deductions for lost product will ever be allowed.  All such costs shall be the responsibility of the lessee.  Lessee shall exercise due diligence and use all reasonable efforts in marketing any and all production from the premises to obtain the best price reasonably available for the oil and gas. 

    g. AFFILIATE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: For purposes of determining the royalty due, the gross production shall be valued at the point of sale and delivery to an unaffiliated third party.

    h. ROYALTIES ON CONTRACT SETTLEMENTS: The lessee shall pay to the lessor 25% of the gross value of any monetary settlement received by the lessee from any breach of contract by lessee’s purchaser relating to the marketing, pricing, or taking of oil or gas production from the premises.

13. DRILLING AND DEVELOPMENT
 
    a. CONTINUOUS DRILLING OBLIGATION:  In addition to any other well or wells commenced on or before the expiration of the primary term, the lessee shall spud in a new well within sixty days after the expiration of the primary term unless on or before such date productive wells have been drilled on the premises to the maximum density permitted by prudent practice. Such follow-up wells shall be drilled to completion in good faith and in a good and workmanlike manner without interruptions totaling no more than sixty days during such drilling operation. Upon the completion of such a well, either as a dry hole or a producing well, the lessee will thereafter diligently conduct continuous drilling operations on the premises with no cessation of more than sixty days between the completion of one well, either as a dry hole or a producing well, and the spudding in of the next well. Each such well shall also be drilled to completion in good faith and in a good and workmanlike manner without interruptions totaling no more than sixty days during each such drilling operation. This drilling obligation shall continue until wells have been drilled on the premises to the maximum density permitted by prudent practice. For purposes of this provision, the completion of a well is defined as the potential test date or the date of plugging, if applicable, appearing on the official completion report filed with the appropriate county office.  Additionally, the lessee will, upon reasonable request from an adjoining lessee of other lands and upon consideration of the provisions in section 18, join with such requesting lessee in pooling to achieve secondary or advanced recovery of oil, gas, and other hydrocarbons that might be produced to the benefit of the lessor through the use of enhanced methods covering a greater area.

    b. PURCHASE OF DRILLING DEFERRAL:  On or before the date upon which the lessee is obligated to spud in a well outlined in section 13(a), the lessee may remit a fee in the amount of one twelfth the annual rental fee as specified in section 19. Timely payment of the deferred drilling fee entitles the lessee to extend the time period for spudding in a well under section 13(a) by thirty days. The lessee may extend the time period for spudding in the well for two additional and successive periods of thirty days each by the payment of a like sum of money on or before the expiration of the then current extended time period. Thereafter, further deferrals will be at the discretion of the lessor.

    c. RELEASE OF UNPRODUCTIVE DEPTHS: Once full development is achieved, all depths below one hundred feet below the deepest depth drilled by the lessee on the Premises shall be released from this lease, regardless of the geological formation so affected. 

14. OFFSET WELLS

    The lessee shall adequately protect the oil and gas under the premises from drainage from adjacent lands or leases. If oil or gas should be produced in paying quantities from a well draining the premises, the lessee shall, within sixty days after such production, begin in good faith and pursue diligently operations leading to the drilling of an offset well and such offset well shall be drilled to such depth as may be necessary to prevent drainage of the premises, and the lessee shall use all means necessary in a good faith effort to make such offset well produces oil or gas in paying quantities. Any vertical well located within one thousand feet of the premises shall be presumed to be draining the premises. Likewise, any horizontal well whose underground network is at any point and for any extent within one thousand feet of the premises shall be presumed to be draining the premises. The lessee may rebut this presumption only with evidence acceptable to the lessor at the lessor’s sole discretion. Delay rental payments, deferred drilling fees, royalties paid or to be paid, shut-in royalty, or other amounts due herein shall not relieve the lessee from its obligations under this section. 

15. SHUT-IN

    If at the expiration of the primary term or at any time thereafter there is located on the premises a well or wells capable of producing oil or gas in paying quantities and such oil or gas is not produced for lack of suitable processing facilities or a suitable market for the gas or oil and such conditions are outside the reasonable control of the lessee, and this lease is not being otherwise maintained in force and effect, then this lease will not terminate and shall be extended for a period of sixty days if the lessee timely submits an application in a form approved by the lessor and, upon approval of said application, pays a shut-in royalty in the amount of one-sixth of the annual rental payment described in section 19 herein at the time the shut-in payment is made. The lessee must remit the shut-in royalty payment, together with any and all required certification to the appropriate county and state agencies, while this lease is otherwise maintained in force and effect. Payment of shut-in royalty after the expiration or other termination of this lease will not revive or extend this lease. The lessee may extend the lease for a maximum of three additional and successive periods of sixty days each by the payment of a like sum of money each sixty day period on or before the expiration of the extended term so long as the conditions that allow such extension continue.  If, while this lease is being maintained in force and effect by payment of such shut-in gas well payments, oil/gas should be sold from a vertically drilled well or wells situated within one thousand feet of the leased premises, or from a horizontally drilled well or wells whose underground network reaches within one thousand feet of the leased premises at any point in its extent, and completed in the same producing reservoir, or in any case where drainage is occurring, the right to further extend this lease by such shut-in well payments shall summarily and immediately cease without forfeiture of any payments paid to the lessor.  Nothing herein shall relieve the lessee of the obligation of reasonable development, nor of the obligation to drill offset wells as required by law or by this lease.

16.  UNOPPOSABLE & OVERWHELMING FORCE (FORCE MAJEURE)

    Whenever as a result of war, rebellion, riots, acts of God, or a governmental law, order, or regulation, the lessee, despite good faith effort, is prevented from exercising any rights or performing any obligations under this lease, and this lease is not kept in force and effect by other provisions contained herein, this lease shall remain in full force and effect for the period of such prevention provided the lessee acts diligently, when possible, to legally overcome such law, order, or regulation that is preventing the lessee from exercising any rights under this lease. This provision shall not operate to extend the lease for a period of more than one year. The operation of this section shall not release the lessee from paying royalties on actual production or the continuing payment of any sum in accordance with a shut-in agreement entered into under section 15.  Strikes, worker shortages or any other human resource problems afflicting the internal operations of the lessee, its contractors or assignees shall not be considered grounds for activating this provision.  During the time this section is in effect, the lessee will pay the lessor a rental fee as described in section 19.

17.  REWORK

    In the event of production of oil or gas from the premises, once obtained, shall cease for any cause other than shut-in or force majeure within sixty days before the expiration of the primary term of this lease or at any time or times thereafter, this lease shall not terminate (i) if the lessee commences additional drilling or reworking operations within sixty days thereafter, and the lease shall remain in full force and effect so long as operations continue in good faith and in workmanlike manner without interruptions totaling no more than sixty days during any one such operation; and if such drilling or reworking operations result in the production of oil or gas, the lease shall remain in full force and effect so long as oil or gas is produced therefrom in paying quantities or payment of shut-in or force majeure rental fee is made as provided herein or (ii) if production in paying quantities is restored within sixty days after such cessation.

18. POOLING

    The lessor reserves the right to refuse any lessee-instigated pooling.  In the event of pooling, whether approved by the lessor or forced by a governmental agency, this lease shall summarily terminate immediately for any rights not included in the pooling or spacing unit.

19. RENTAL PAYMENTS

    After expiration of the primary term, rental payments (expressed here on an annualized basis) shall be adjusted for inflation according to the following mathematical formula: 


        $________ x acreage under lease x (1 + CPI/100 from year 1 subsequent to primary term) x 
        (1 + CPI/100 from year 2 subsequent to primary term) ... x 
        (1 + (fraction of the present year already past) x 
        (the most recently reported CPI available/100)), 


    where 'CPI' stands for the annualized consumer price index for the United States of America expressed as a percent, where the dots (...) represent a logical continuation of the series based on the preceding sequence and where acreage means only those acres not already released from the lease at the point in time the rental is due.

20.  COMMUNICATION WITH THE LESSOR

    In addition to the communications already stipulated in this lease, the lessee shall provide the lessor with timely information regarding: (1) title opinions, (2) drilling and drilling completion reports, (3) well logs, (4) drilling permits, (5) any mineral discoveries made during the course of drilling and (5) any other audit data needed for a fair and timely determination of royalty payments

21.  PICTORIAL REPRESENTATION OF ALL STATES RECOGNIZED BY LEASE

![Image](graph.png?raw=true)
    
    This directed graph is a pictorial representation of the lease. The eleven ovals indicate mutually ­exclusive states in which the lease can exist. Arrows define 21 possible transitions, 6 of which are bidirectional.  Bidirectionality indicates that the lease can toggle between the two states so connected. The time intervals annotating the arrows indicate the maximum contiguous block of time the lease is allowed to remain in the indicated state before it automatically transitions to termination by default. The colors of the ovals indicate income to the lessor: white indicates no income, light green means rental income and dark green means production royalties. At the beginning of a lease, a single well is under consideration. But depending on the particulars of the situation, the obligation to drill an additional well is incurred. These points are referred to as 'spawn pts' in the diagram.
